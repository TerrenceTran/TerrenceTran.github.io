**Objective:** 11a. Maze LED Ring

**Progress Today:** To add to the playability of Console 11, an LED ring was to be added so that the user could see where the magnets were behind the scenes. The LED ring is an (Adafruit NeoPixel Ring)[https://www.adafruit.com/product/1643], chosen because of its easy of programing and connection.
